SQUARE'D

Play at: http://petemilkman.com/canvas-game/

Dual-axis control scheme game made with HTML5 Canvas 2D. Drawing inspiration from
old games like SmashTV, Robotron 2094, Crimson Land, and Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved.

Controls
W,A,S,D or arrow keys to move.
Mouse to aim, click to fire (hold down button for rapid fire)

Should be obvious that everything is placeholder at this point. This game is still
in extreme pre-alpha.
